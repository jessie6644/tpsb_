## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

When: Oct 31 2021

Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

Making regular meetings and supporting those without previous experience allowed us to ensure that every member of the group got on track well, and is in good shape to work for the next deliverable.

Using Trello gave some idea of guidance for what we were doing for deliverable 2. This was useful to some extent for keeping on track, although perhaps not used as effectively as it could be. [Link to Trello](https://trello.com/b/YHNGEgzD/workflow)

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

We learned APIs as we worked on Deliverable 2. Thus we did not design APIs ahead of time, and there was limited testing, with none written before some code. It would have been far more effective to plan and make tests for the API ahead of time, as it resulted in a lot of back and forth for frontend and backend.

Many people using the same feature branches at once. This resulted in merges while people were still working on it, some minor lost work and some confusion.

There was no deployed version until late in the process which meant minimal testing of the production environment. This was partially due to backend and frontend being done simultaneously. This resulted in a lot of confusion close to the deadline.

### Q3. Planned changes

We want a more detailed Trello board (using meetings to decide many smaller tasks), that are more modular. This is to give a better, more specific idea of what is being worked on, and less non-descriptive general tasks.

Planning out anything that requires interaction between backend and frontend fully before starting development. Unplanned development due to lack of knowledge in certain areas resulted in, essentially chaos, which was not very productive.

Only one person to one branch per features, so branches, changes and cooperation is modular and more agile.

Plan to have a bare minimum deployed version farther ahead of the deadline. This will allow for effective QA testing, and a clear idea of possible next steps for the product.

## Product - Review

### Q4. How was your product demo?

We prepared our demo by planning out a screen-share of how the application would be presented. First backend admin website functionality, then frontend, what would be displayed to the public.

We demoed all the functionality that the production version of our application has. The screen-share presentation lasted for 20 minutes, with 15 about how to edit on the admin website, and 5 spent on the frontend public page. Then another 8 minutes of final feedback and questions.

Our partner accepted the features we proposed and was satisfied overall. He expressed some change requests for some of the implemented features. As an exemple, the embed youtube video was not necessary and maybe confusing. Another change he mentioned was having a dropdown or even opening a new tab with the agenda content instead of having it appear at the bottom). Also the identification of minutes through a specific minute formatting he will share with us in the coming days and the ordering of the agendas from most recent to oldest ones in both the backend and the frontend. Finally, the partner would prefer if there were no link to the Admin site on the final product for the sake of security.

Additionally, he had a non-mvp feature request: for the ordering of the agenda items, he suggested a drag and drop or similarly easy to use system if possible.

We learned that having a demo and regular checkups on the advancement of your product is important since there might be request changes or there might be misinterpretations of features on our part. It is important to know what the user of your product thinks of your current product and make sure your work aligns with his objectives. The partner reiterated his priorities with respect to some functionalities, underlined some important points for some coming functionalities and asked for some changes of implemented functionalities. By having a solid and regular communication with your partner, you ensure that you do not waste time and work towards a good product.
